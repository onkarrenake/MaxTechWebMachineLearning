This directory contains Google Cloud Endpoints Frameworks for App Engine for
App Engine Standard samples. The [`backend/`](backend/) directory contains the
sample code for the [quickstart][4] for Cloud Endpoints Frameworks on App Engine
using an OpenAPI development process. The [`migration-example/`](migration-example/) directory
contains the sample code for a [migrated][2] version of the [Cloud Endpoints
Frameworks][1] sample project to the new [Cloud Endpoints Frameworks for App Engine][8]
development process.

The new Google Cloud Endpoints Frameworks for App Engine provides
[additional functionality][3] using OpenAPI which may require payment.
It's recommended that you migrate projects using the prior version of [Cloud Endpoints Frameworks][1].
