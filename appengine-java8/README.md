manage all Google Cloud Platform resources for your app, including deployment,
access control, billing, and services.

1. Open the [Cloud Platform Console][cloud-console].
1. In the drop-down menu at the top, select **Create a project**.
1. Give your project a name.
1. Make a note of the project ID, which might be different from the project
   name. The project ID is used in commands and in configurations.
